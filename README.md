For Code-Fundo competition

We will build an Web Portal which will include the following features to prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters:

1. The Portal will have the access of the current location of the user - Based on the last location of the user, if any natural disaster is expected to occur or has already happened, we will send SMS to your 5 saved contacts (These contacts will be saved by the user in the Portal). Location will be keep on updating.

2. The Portal will notify if any natural disaster has happened or expected to happen in any part of the country and if it's range is in vicinity of your location, it will flash emergency contacts of the nearby helpcentres such as Hospital Contacts, Police stations, NGOs etc.
It will also help people to get prepared if any calamity is expected in their area, hence it will help to save lives and economic property.

3. The Portal will also update the Relief Programs being carried by the Government or NGOs in the affected area so that the people who are stuck can know about the developments in the Rescue operations. 

4. It will also contain a pre-defined format in which the user can provide any information regarding any situation in which he is stuck in or he knows about any other person. The information will be sent to the concerned authority depending on the type of situation.

Through this idea, we have tried to cover all the dimensions for the rescue and management during the natural disaster.
